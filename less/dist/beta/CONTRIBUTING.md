## Bug Reports

 - Please create a short test case
 - Test with the latest version
 - indicate how you use less - browser/lessc/external tool

## Feature Requests

 - Please search feature requests to see if something similar exists already
 - include a use-case - we do not add language features without a reason
 - consider whether your language feature would be better as a function

## Pull Requests

Thankyou!

 - Please add a feature request first to see if people are pro or con. If it is solving an existing issue, but is different, add a new issue and make sure you get agreement from a couple of the core contributors. Otherwise you risk your hard work being rejected.
 - do not change the dist/ folder - we do this when releasing
 - tests - please add tests for your work. use `make test` to see if they pass node.js tests and `make browser-test` to see the browser (PhantomJS) tests pass.
 - spaces not tabs
 - end lines in semi-colons - loosely aim towards jslint standards (alot of code fails already - don't just follow this pattern if it is bad practice)

## Developing

If you want to take an issue just add a small comment saying you are having a go at something, so we don't get duplication.
